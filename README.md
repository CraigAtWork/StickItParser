StickItParser
=============

DOM parser for backbone.stickit data binding.

backbone.stickit.js is a great data binding package for Backbone applications.

On occasion, you need bindings specified in the markup. For example, if you want to generate the bindings in a templating language like Handlebars.

Use this package to add markup declared bindings. 

```html
<input id="some-id" type="text" data-bind="value:myModelAttribute"/>
```

The binding syntax has a Knockout flavor to it. See the examples for more depth.
